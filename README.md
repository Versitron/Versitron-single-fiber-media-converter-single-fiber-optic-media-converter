## What Is a Single Fiber Media Converter?

A **single fiber media converter** uses WDM to send and receive data simultaneously over one fiber strand by utilizing different wavelengths for transmission and reception. This reduces fiber cabling requirements by half compared to traditional dual-fiber systems, simplifying deployment and lowering costs.
